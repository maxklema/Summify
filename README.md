# Summify

Summify is a browser extension that summarizes content on web pages, articles, and YouTube videos using Google Gemini's node.js API.

## Usage

Once Summify is installed, using it is really easy.

Whenever you are viewing content, you will have the option to select the summary length.

Snippet (Default) → Shorter (~100-250 words)

Detailed → Longer (~250 - 500 words)

Then, just press the 'Summarize' button at the bottom of the extension, and Summify will do its magic!
